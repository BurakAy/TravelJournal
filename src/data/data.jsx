      "Ephesus was an ancient port city whose well-preserved ruins are in modern-day Turkey. Much of Ephesusâ€™s ancient history is unrecorded and sketchy. What is known is that in the seventh century B.C., Ephesus fell under the rule of the Lydian Kings and became a thriving city where men and women enjoyed equal opportunities. It was also the birthplace of the renowned philosopher Heraclitus.",
